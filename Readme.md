# Explore and extend the Chess Cloud Database 

Explores and searches [chessdb.cn](https://chessdb.cn/queryc_en/), the largest online database (db) of chess positions and openings.

## Purpose

Build a search tree from a particular position, using a mini-max like algorithm,
finding the best line, extending the db as needed.

Using some concurrency, fairly deep exploration is quickly possible.

## `cdbsearch`

This is a command line program to explore a single position.

```
usage: cdbsearch.py [-h] [--epd EPD | --san SAN] [--depthLimit DEPTHLIMIT] [--concurrency CONCURRENCY] [--evalDecay EVALDECAY] [--cursedWins] [--TBsearch] [--proveMates] [--user USER]

Explore and extend the Chess Cloud Database (https://chessdb.cn/queryc_en/). Builds a search tree for a given position.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --epd EPD             EPD/FEN to explore: acceptable are FENs w/ and w/o move counters, as well as the extended "moves m1 m2 m3" syntax from cdb's API. (default: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - moves g2g4)
  --san SAN             Moves in SAN notation that lead to the position to be explored. E.g. "1. g4". (default: None)
  --depthLimit DEPTHLIMIT
                        Finish the exploration at the specified depth. (default: None)
  --concurrency CONCURRENCY
                        Concurrency of requests. This is the maximum number of http requests made to chessdb at the same time. (default: 16)
  --evalDecay EVALDECAY
                        Depth decrease per cp eval-to-best. A small number will use a very narrow search, 0 will essentially just follow PV lines. A wide search will likely enqueue many positions. (default: 2)
  --cursedWins          Treat cursed wins as wins. (default: False)
  --TBsearch            Extend the searching and exploration of lines into cdb's EGTB. (default: False)
  --proveMates          Attempt to prove that mate PV lines have no better defence. Proven mates are indicated with "CHECKMATE" at the end of the PV, whereas unproven ones use "checkmate". (default: False)
  --user USER           Add this username to the http user-agent header. (default: None)
``` 

Sample output:

unscored   : Number of existing unscored moves within cdb that were assigned a score as part of the search.
reprobed   : Number of positions in local PV lines re-requested to cdb.
inflightQ  : Number of concurrent queries, guaranteed to return scored moves, made to cdb on average.
inflightR  : Number of concurrent http requests made to chessdb.cn on average.
cdb time   : Average time (in milliseconds) needed to get a cdb list of moves for a position (including those that required enqueuing).
date       : ... you guessed it
total time : Time spent since the start of the search.
URL        : Link displaying the found PV on chessdb.cn.

## `cdbbulksearch`

This is a command line program to sequentially explore several positions.

```
usage: cdbbulksearch.py [-h] [--plyBegin PLYBEGIN] [--plyEnd PLYEND] [--shuffle] [--depthLimit DEPTHLIMIT] [--concurrency CONCURRENCY] [--evalDecay EVALDECAY] [--cursedWins] [--TBsearch] [--proveMates] [--user USER] [--bulkConcurrency BULKCONCURRENCY] [--forever] [--reload] filename

Invoke cdbsearch for positions loaded from a file.

positional arguments:
  filename              PGN file if suffix is .pgn, o/w a text file with FENs/EPDs. The latter may use the extended "moves m1 m2 m3" syntax from cdb's API.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --plyBegin PLYBEGIN   Ply in each line of filename from which positions will be searched by cdbsearch. A value of 0 corresponds to the starting FEN without any moves played. Negative values count from the back, as per the Python standard. (default: -1)
  --plyEnd PLYEND       Ply in each line of filename until which positions will be searched by cdbsearch. A value of None means including the final move of the line. (default: None)
  --shuffle             Shuffle the positions to be searched randomly. (default: False)
  --depthLimit DEPTHLIMIT
                        Argument passed to cdbsearch. (default: 5)
  --concurrency CONCURRENCY
                        Argument passed to cdbsearch. (default: 16)
  --evalDecay EVALDECAY
                        Argument passed to cdbsearch. (default: 2)
  --cursedWins          Argument passed to cdbsearch. (default: False)
  --TBsearch            Argument passed to cdbsearch. (default: False)
  --proveMates          Argument passed to cdbsearch. (default: False)
  --user USER           Argument passed to cdbsearch. (default: None)
  --bulkConcurrency BULKCONCURRENCY
                        Number of concurrent processes running cdbsearch. (default: 4)
  --forever             Pass positions from filename to cdbsearch in an infinite loop, increasing depthLimit by one after each completed cycle. (default: False)
  --reload              Reload positions from filename when tasks for new cycle are needed. (default: False)
```

Example:
```shell
echo '[Event "*"]\n\n1. g4 *\n\n1. g4 d5 *\n' > book.pgn
git clone https://github.com/vondele/cdbexplore && pip install -r cdbexplore/requirements.txt
python3 cdbexplore/cdbbulksearch.py book.pgn --forever >& cdbsearch_book.log &
```
